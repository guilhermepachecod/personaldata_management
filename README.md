The program consists of a register of people where it is possible to navigate between 
the registers, add, remove and update the registers.
The application has two databases, one already populated with several false registrations 
and another completely empty so that users can use only their own records.

The project aims to serve as advanced query for PHP, Javascript, JSON, JQuery and Mysql 
connection codes, as well as serving as a registry of people with basic information.
The scripts were thought of as little code usage as possible using best security 
practices at the moment.
The project is also part of my larger project, which is to create a portfolio so that 
future clients have access to some of my technical capabilities.

In order to install and use the project, the user needs a standard web server with access 
to HTML, PHP 7.2, MySQL 14.14 and all the infrastructure to support these applications.

Run the database dump file, choose between the zero version or the one version that is the 
one with 378 records.
Access the psl-config.php file and change the information for connecting to the database.
Set the values ​​to HOST, USER, PASSWORD.
For production environments, also change the SECURE option.
